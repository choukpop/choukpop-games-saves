Direct3D: detected that using refresh rate causes time drift. Will stop trusting refresh rate until the game window is moved.
Direct3D: detected that vsync is broken (it does not limit frame rate properly). Delta time will now be calculated using cpu-side time stampling until the game window is moved.
