# FAQ
**Isn't this just a cheating mod?**<br/>
Yes and no. Obviously it can be used as a cheating mod. But if that is what you want to do, why not? As long as you do not ruin the fun of others, you do you. That said, this mod is also very useful for server Admins as it can help them in several different ways.

**Can I prevent players from using this on my server?**<br/>
Not by default. If you have (a) mod(s) installed that prevents players from installing unapproved mods, then this mod will not work on your server either. QoL contains no code that tries to hide itself from usage or bypass any form of security.

**Is this mod potentially dangerous for servers?**<br/>
Technically yes. A user could for example abuse the mod to spawn hundreds of bosses in. Other than that however, QoL will never implement any truly dangerous features.

**Which "dangerous" features will not be implemented into QoL?**
 > \- Overriding Wards<br/>
 > \- Controlling Wards not belonging to the user<br/>
 > \- Regenerating terrain / nature / dungeons<br/>
 > \- Practically any feature that'll most likely affect other players on a large scale if abused
