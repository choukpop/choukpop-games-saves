## About this mod

Allows you to replace instances of game textures with custom png files.

## Description

This mod should allow you to replace the following:

player model textures
item inventory icons
equipment textures like armor, weapons, and tools
terrain and water textures
environmental textures
special location textures (villages, crypts, rune stones, etc.)
world object textures, almost everything else in the game world

It also now supports layers, so you can apply multiple textures to the same vanilla texture (see Layers below).

To create your own custom textures requires basic reading comprehension! It's not that difficult, but please read all of the information on the Nexus page for this mod before asking aedenthorn for help.

## Config

A config file BepInEx/config/aedenthorn.CustomTextures.cfg is created after running the game once with this mod).

You can adjust the config values by editing this file using a text editor or in-game using the Config Manager(F1)ï»¿.

## Technical

To install manually, place the dll file in the BepInEx/plugins folder. You will need BepInEx.
