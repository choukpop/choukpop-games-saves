Shortens teleportation loading time to save those precious 8 seconds of our lives. Also makes entering dungeons instant.

---


Stop being robbed of your 8 seconds of life waiting for the teleportation animation to finish with the fixed timer.
Instead, it will only wait for the area to be loaded and ready which be anywhere between instant to few seconds based only on your computer.

The mod also completely removes loading for any dungeons making you enter them instantly.

Great for teleporting around your house/construction.

It will move the player faster than the screen will get black, so you can briefly see things loading in, but I can't do much with that...

# Config
Timer's start time is modifiable through config in Valheim/BepInEx/config/GemHunter1.FastTeleport.cfg
Or use Configuration Manager's in-game F1 panel.

# Installation
This mod depends on BepInEx for Valheim. You can install it manually by copying the mod's .dll file into your Valheim/BepInEx/plugins folder.

# Server compatibility
Client-side mod works with any server.
