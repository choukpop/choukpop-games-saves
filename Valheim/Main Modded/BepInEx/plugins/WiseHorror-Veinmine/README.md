Tired of mining for ages?  
With Veinmine you're able to mine the whole ore/rock vein at once!  
You can do this by holding down the assigned key (Left Alt by default) while mining!

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

## **Version 1.0.0 - Progressive mode added!**

### **Please delete your previous config when updating as it might break something.**

You can now enable progressive mode in the config, making it so veinmining is scaled by your Pickaxes level. This is
intended to be a less OP way of veinmining, where the tradeoff is taking higher durability damage (and less xp) than if
you mined manually.

The radius of the veinmined area is also scaled by your Pickaxes level.

It works by checking for rocks in a radius set by the Progressive Level Multiplier value in the config. This value is
multiplied by your Pickaxes level to obtain a radius.

By default, it's set to 0.1 so assuming your Pickaxes level is 20, the radius will be 0.1 * 20 = 2.

What does 2 mean, you ask?

It's simple! A standard 2x2 floor piece has a length of 2, exactly like its name suggests.
