## 1.2.7

- Fixed mod being broken.
- Infinite durability can now be enabled for progressive mode.

### 1.2.6

- Compatibility with Mistlands and fix for Silver ore exception.

### 1.2.5

- Tentative fix for multiplayer veinmining by replacing the use of Player.m_localPlayer with Player.GetClosestPlayer.

### 1.2.4

- Fixed an exception that was thrown when mining Leviathans.
- Added veinmining support for Leviathans and Glowing Metal (Flametal Ore).

### 1.2.3

- Fixed a bug that allowed players to veinmine (and gain exp) without a pickaxe.

### 1.2.2

- Possible fix for ore drop quantities (Not sure why they weren't correct, as I don't change drop rates)

### 1.2.1

- Compatibility for Hearth and Home;
- Tentative fix for ores spawning at 0,0 (unable to test without other players)

### 1.2.0

- Replaced 'Even' spread damage option with 'Level' as even was useless when the mined vein had a large number of
  sections.
- Refactored code.

### 1.1.9

- Fixed incompatibility with Rocky Ore mod.

### 1.1.8

- Fixed a bug that was causing no ores to be dropped (hopefully)

### 1.1.7

- Fixed a bug that caused ores to drop every single pickaxe swing when mining manually.

### 1.1.6

- Fixed a bug that was causing no drops to be received when veinmining.

### 1.1.5

#### Please delete your previous config when updating to this version.

- Damage text when veinmining should now display on top of each rock section
- Veinmining when Progressive mode is disabled is now instant
- Spread damage now has two options: Even and Distance
    - Even is the same as previous versions
    - Distance makes it so the damage dealt to a rock section is based on distance. The farther away a section is, the
      less damage is dealt.

### 1.1.4

- Fixed a bug where if you had spread damage enabled, mining damage would also be reduced when mining manually.

### 1.1.3

- Added config option for spreading damage in progressive mode (divides your mining damage equally between all rock
  sections affected, as opposed to doing full damage to all sections)
- This is disabled by default.

### 1.1.2

- Fixed incompatibility with mods that alter the pickaxe's durability drain values. The value modified by such mods (
  m_useDurabilityDrain) is now multiplied by the result of the previous formula (which is shown in the config). Take
  this into account when editing this mod's durability modifier.

### 1.1.1

- Added config options for durability and xp multipliers for Progressive mode.

### 1.1.0

- Durability taken is now scaled to the player's Pickaxes level when Progressive mode is enabled. This is meant to (
  somewhat) balance veinmining so it fits in with vanilla.
- The formula is (120 - Level) / 20, so if you have level 50: (120 - 50) / 20 = 3.5 durability taken **per rock section
  veinmined**

### 1.0.1

- Removed log messages to avoid spam.

### 1.0.0

- Added Progressive mode.

#### 0.0.1.4

- Fixed a bug that allowed monsters to veinmine and/or give XP to the player.

#### 0.0.1.3

- Indestructible items no longer lose durability. (such as items from Epic Loot)
- Added config option to disable mining visual effects, which *might* help reduce fps lag. (disabled by default)

#### 0.0.1.2

- Added config option for veinmining to take pickaxe durability for each section mined (default = true).
- XP is now only awarded if the section mined wasn't already destroyed.
- Fixed a NullReferenceException thrown when there were more than 128 rock sections.

#### 0.0.1.1

- Mining xp is now awarded for every rock section mined.

#### 0.0.1.0

- Initial release
