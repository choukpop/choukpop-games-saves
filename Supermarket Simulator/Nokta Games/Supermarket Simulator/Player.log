BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.
The effective box size has been forced positive and is likely to give unexpected collision geometry.
If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "---GAME---/Store/Storage/Walls/Showcase_Store_08/Showcase_Store_Door_08"
