"Description": "Directs the movement of trains to avoid collisions and bottlenecks.

Block Signals can be placed on Railways to create 'Blocks' between them. When a train is occupying one of these Blocks, other trains will be unable to enter it.

Caution: Signals are directional! Trains are unable to move against this direction, so be sure to set up Signals in both directions for bi-directional Railways.",
