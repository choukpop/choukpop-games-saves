"Description": "Enables pioneer teleportation between two linked Portals.

Each Portal can only have a single link. 
A link can only be made between a Main and Satellite Portal.

Singularity Cells need to be supplied to the Main Portal and will be consumed to establish and maintain the Portal link.

WARNINGS:
- Massive power draw will occur during start-up and usage.
- Power draw on use increases with travel distance.
- Link start-up will take time. Letting the connection expire is not recommended.
- Failure to deliver sufficient Singularity Cells will cause the link to expire.
- FICSIT does not condone the use of wormhole technology. Any usage of wormhole technology is at the user's own risk.",
