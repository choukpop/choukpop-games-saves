"Description": "Directs the movement of trains to avoid collisions and bottlenecks.

Path Signals are advanced signals that are especially useful for bi-directional Railways and complex intersections. They function similarly to Block Signals, but rather than occupying the entire Block, trains can reserve a specific path through it and will only enter the Block if their path allows them to fully pass through.

Caution: Signals are directional! Trains are unable to move against this direction, so be sure to set up Signals in both directions for bi-directional Railways.",
